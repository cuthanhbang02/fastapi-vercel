To achieve this, uncover one of the bowls of icing and whisk in Â¼ teaspoon of water at a time until you reach the correct consistency. It should be thick but still pourable. Transfer to a piping bag with a small circle decorating tip. Create an outline of frosting around the edge of your cooled sugar cookies and then let set for about 5 minutes."", 
""The second royal icing application is referred to as flooding. To achieve this, uncover one of the bowls of icing and whisk in Â¼ teaspoon of water at a time until you reach the correct consistency. It should be thinner than the first and pourable.

Then quickly pipe the icing into the center of each outlined cookie, tilting the cookie so that the icing spread out towards the outline. Use a long skewer or toothpick to help spread the icing a bit if needed or to remove any air bubbles. Allow the icing to set for about 10 to 15 minutes before storing or eating.""
